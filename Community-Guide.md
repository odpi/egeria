# Egeria Community Guide

willing to follow the simple processes outlined below, as well as adhere to the 
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

There is also a mailing list.

### Connecting to Slack

Egeria uses the [LF AI & Data Slack community](http://slack.lfai.foundation) to provide an ongoing dialogue between members.
This creates a recorded discussion of design decisions and discussions that complement the project meetings.

Follow the link above and register with the LF AI & Data slack service using your email address.
Once signed in you can see all of the active slack channels.
The main slack channel for the Egeria project is called `#egeria-discussion`

Additional channels are added from time to time as new workgroups and discussion topics are established. For Egeria these
channel names will begin with '#egeria'. You can also view slack channels from other LF AI & Data projects.


More information about slack is available in the [developer-resources/tools](developer-resources/tools/Slack.md) pages.

## Egeria's Git repositories

The Egeria project used [GitHub](https://github.com/odpi)
to maintain its content.  It has the following repositories:

* [egeria](https://github.com/odpi/egeria) - contains the core Egeria function along with samples, tutorials and documentation.
* [egeria-connector-hadoop-ecosystem](https://github.com/odpi/egeria-connector-hadoop-ecosystem) - contains connectors to integrate
technologies from the hadoop ecosystem into the open metadata ecosystem.
* [egeria-connector-ibm-information-server](https://github.com/odpi/egeria-connector-ibm-information-server) - contains connectors to integrate IBM Information Server into the open metadata ecosystem.
* [data-governance](https://github.com/odpi/data-governance) - contains Egeria's Guidance on Governance (GoG) as well as
large media files such as presentations and movies.
* [egeria-dev-projects](https://github.com/odpi/egeria-dev-projects) - contains fun projects for developers to help them learn about the Egeria technology.
* [egeria-palisade](https://github.com/odpi/egeria-palisade) - contains content from the collaboration between
the Egeria project and the [Palisade](https://github.com/gchq/palisade) project.

All of these repositories are publicly visible.  However, if you want to contribute new content then you need
to create a GitHub account.  This can be created from the top of the GitHub home page.

If you are not familiar with Git and GitHub, there is additional education in the
[developer-resources/tools](developer-resources/tools/Git-GitHub.md) pages.

## Steps to contribute content to the project

Egeria uses [GitHub's fork and pull model](https://help.github.com/articles/about-collaborative-development-models/)
to create a contribution.
This process is described in detail in the
[Egeria Dojo Education](open-metadata-resources/open-metadata-tutorials/egeria-dojo/egeria-dojo-day-2-3-contribution-to-egeria.md).

There are additional resources for contributors under [developer-resources](developer-resources).
Review the [developer guidelines](developer-resources/Developer-Guidelines.md)
to understand the requirements associated with new content for Egeria.

Every contribution is signed to say that the contributor has the rights to make the contribution and
agrees with the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](developer-resources/why-the-dco.md)

### Creating a Linux Foundation account

The Linux Foundation provide build and distribution facilities.
You need an account to access some of the reports from the build.

This is the link to create a [Linux Foundation account](https://identity.linuxfoundation.org). 
Note the username and password you selected.
