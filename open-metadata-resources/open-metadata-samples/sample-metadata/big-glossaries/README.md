# Big glossaries

This utility creates 10 glossaries of 10,000 unique terms each in their own archive file.  They are named as follows:

* BigGlossaryA.json
  * BigGlossaryA
     * TermA00001
     *  :
     * TermA10000
  * BigGlossaryB
      * TermB00001
      *  :
      * TermB10000
  *    :
  * BigGlossaryJ
      * TermJ00001
      *  :
      * TermJ10000

They are used for testing a deployment environment to make sure it has enough resources to manage a large repository.

The utility is easily extended to create more terms per glossary, or create additional glossaries.
