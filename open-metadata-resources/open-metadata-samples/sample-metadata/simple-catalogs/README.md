# Simple catalogs

This utility creates four open metadata archives used to demonstrate the
behavior of an open metadata repository cohort to link together
metadata from different repositories.  The metadata archives
are as follows:

* SimpleEventCatalog - contains topics and event types
* SimpleAPICatalog - contains definitions of APIs
* SimpleDataCatalog - contains definitions of data sources
* SimpleGovernanceCatalog - contains the governance definitions and linkage between the elements in the other catalog

Each archive is loaded into its own Egeria Metadata Server and these servers are
connected together through a cohort.  The servers can be queried through scripts or the UIs.
