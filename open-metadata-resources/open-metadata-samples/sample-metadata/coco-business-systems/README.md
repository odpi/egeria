# Coco Pharmaceuticals Business Systems

This sample loads metadata into a metadata repository that represents the
business systems and the data movement between them for Coco Pharmaceuticals
Human Resources, Finance, Procurement, Sales and Distribution as well as the
transfer of this data to the data lake.

Its content is intended for the cocoMDS5 repository in the open metadata labs,
but it can be loaded into any metadata server.  It is useful for showing the value
of a data catalog and lineage.  Other activity in the labs may extend the lineage
from this sample.
