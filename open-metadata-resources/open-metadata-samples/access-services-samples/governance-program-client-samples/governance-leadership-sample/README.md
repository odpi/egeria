# Governance Leadership Sample

In the governance leadership sample, 
[Jules Keeper](https://egeria-project.org/practices/coco-pharmaceuticals/personas/jules-keeper/), the CDO at
Coco Pharmaceuticals, is setting up details about the team of governance leaders
who will drive the different domains of 
[Coco Pharmaceuticals governance program](https://egeria-project.org/practices/coco-pharmaceuticals/).
Together they will form the Governance Board that will lead Coco Pharmaceuticals business
transformation to personalized medicine.

Jules first creates a personal profile for himself and
[Ivor Padlock](https://egeria-project.org/practices/coco-pharmaceuticals/personas/ivor-padlock/).

Next he creates governance officer positions for:

* The Chief Data Officer (CDO)
* The Chief Privacy Officer (CPO)
* The Chief Security Officer (CSO)

He appoints himself as the CDO and the CPO and Ivor as the CSO.

He later persuades [Faith Broker](https://egeria-project.org/practices/coco-pharmaceuticals/personas/faith-broker/) to take on the role of CPO.
He creates a new profile for Faith, removes himself as the CPO
and appoints Faith in his place.

He also updates his personal profile to reflect he is no longer CPO.

Jules also wants to recognize the work that [Erin Overview](https://egeria-project.org/practices/coco-pharmaceuticals/personas/erin-overview/)
does in supporting the information architecture for their
systems and also [Gary Geeke's](https://egeria-project.org/practices/coco-pharmaceuticals/personas/gary-geeke/) work running the IT infrastructure.

He appoints Erin as the CDO for the IT Systems and
Gary as the Chief IT Officer responsible for the
IT governance domain.

Completing the team, [Reggie Mint](https://egeria-project.org/practices/coco-pharmaceuticals/personas/reggie-mint/) from finance is the corporate
governance officer and [Polly Tasker](https://egeria-project.org/practices/coco-pharmaceuticals/personas/polly-tasker/) is responsible for the
software development lifecycle governance domain.

Talking to Ivor at a later date, they decide to change the
"Chief Security Officer (CSO)" to be the "Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)".

Throughout the sample, Jules is checking that he can retrieve the
definitions that he is creating.

At the end of the sample, all the definitions are deleted so the sample can run again without error.
