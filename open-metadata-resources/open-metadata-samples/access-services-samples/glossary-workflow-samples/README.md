# Glossary management samples

The glossary management samples show different styles of managing changes to glossary terms.
They are illustrated through the [Asset Manager OMAS glossary management API](https://odpi.github.io/egeria/org/odpi/openmetadata/accessservices/assetmanager/api/management/GlossaryManagementInterface.html).
This interface is used by [Glossary Workflow OMVS](https://egeria-project.org/services/omvs/glossary-workflow/overview) to provide the backend services for UI that provide complex management interfaces.
