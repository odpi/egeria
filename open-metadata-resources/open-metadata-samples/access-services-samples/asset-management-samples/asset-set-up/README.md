# The Asset Set Up Utility (asset-set-up)

The *Asset Set Up Utility* creates a variety of data-oriented assets that you can use to explore the open metadata and governance APIs.

This utility works from a set of hard-coded defaults that you can change for your environment.  
There is also plenty of scope to add new options to configure different types of assets and
features.
