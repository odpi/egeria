# Survey Report (survey-report)

The survey report published survey information about a particular resource.  The survey information is found in the open metadata ecosystem.  It is linked off of the resource's asset in [Survey Reports](https://egeria-project.org/concepts/survey-report/).  This report extracts the survey information and organizes it into a report.

The report is in two parts:

* The first part lists the lists each of the survey reports linked to the asset and the reported annotations. 
* The second part lists the elements associated with the reported annotations and summarises their associated annotations to provide a view of how they are changing over time.

The report is printed out to the console and is available in a markdown formatted file called "survey-report-for-asset-<i>guid</i>-<i>date</i>.md".
