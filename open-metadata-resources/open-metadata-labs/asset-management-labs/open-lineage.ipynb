    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Egeria is an open source project that provides open standards and implementation libraries to connect tools, catalogs and platforms together so they can share information (called metadata) about data and the technology that supports it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this hands-on lab you will get a chance to work with Egeria metadata and governance servers and learn how to manually create  metadata to describe lineage for data movement processes. For this purpose we use **Open Lineage Services** governance server solution designed to capture and manage a historical warehouse of lineage information.\n",
    "We will also show how using General **Egeria UI** you can search data assets and visualize lineage previously created.\n",

    "## The Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "The Egeria team use the personas and scenarios from the fictitious company called Coco Pharmaceuticals. (See https://opengovernance.odpi.org/coco-pharmaceuticals/ for more information).\n",
    "\n",
    "On their business transformation journey after they successfully created data catalog for the data lake, new challenge emerges. Due to regulatory requirements, business came up with request to improve data traceability. Introducing data lineage for critical data flows was ideal use-case for the next level of maturity in their governance program.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we discover how to manually catalogue data assets in the data lake and describe data movement for simple data transformation process executed by their in-house built ETL tool. Finally, the users can find data assets and visualize end to end lineage in the web UI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Peter Profile and Erin Overview got assigned to work on a solution to capture and report data lineage using Egeria. \n"

    "Coco Pharmaceuticals make widespread use of Egeria for tracking and managing their data and related assets.\n",
    "Figure 1 below shows their metadata servers and the Open Metadata and Governance (OMAG) Server Platforms that are hosting them.  Each metadata server supports a department in the organization.  The servers are distributed across the platform to even out the workload.  Servers can be moved to a different platform if needed.\n",

    "For the scope of this lab, we are going to interact with two servers hosted on Data Lake platform:\n",
    " - `cocoMDS1` as metadata repository to store all the assets;\n",
    " - `cocoOLS1` as dedicated governance server to enable open lineage services and historical lineage repository;\n",
    " \n",
    " - `UI platform` running the APIs to support Egeria UI application. \n",
    " \n",
    " > **Important**: When running this lab using [`kubernetes deployment`](https://odpi.github.io/egeria-docs/guides/operations/kubernetes/charts/lab/) the UI Platform is already configured and started for you.\n",
    "\n",
