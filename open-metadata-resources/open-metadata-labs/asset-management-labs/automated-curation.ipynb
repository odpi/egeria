    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Egeria is an open source project that provides open standards and implementation libraries to connect tools, catalogs and platforms together so they can share information about data and technology (called metadata).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [Building a Data Catalog](building-a-data-catalog.ipynb) lab, Peter Profile and Erin Overivew\n",
    "manually catalogued the weekly measurement files for the Drop Foot clinical trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this hands-on lab you will get a chance to work with Egeria's governance servers to\n",
    "automate this onboarding process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "[Coco Pharmaceuticals](https://opengovernance.odpi.org/coco-pharmaceuticals/)\n",
    "is conducting a clinical trial with two hospitals: Oak Dene Hospital and Old Market Hospital.\n",
    "Each week the two hospitals send Coco Pharmaceuticals a set of measurements from the patients\n",
    "involved in the trial.  These measurements are located in a CSV file that the hospital sends through\n",
    "secure file transfer to a folder in Coco Pharmaceutical's landing area.\n",
    "\n",
    "These files need to be copied into the data lake and catalogued so that they are only visible to the\n",
    "staff involved in the clinical trial.  It is also important that the lineage of these files is\n",
    "maintained so the source of the data can be traced.  This process is shown in Figure 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Scenario](../images/automated-curation-scenario.png)\n",

    "Peter Profile and Erin Overview are responsible for this onboarding process.\n",
    "![Peter and Erin](../images/peter-and-erin.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "They have defined a list of requirements for the process:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Files must be in the landing area for a minimum amount of time.\n",
    "* As a new file is received, it needs to be catalogued, including:\n",
    "   * Description\n",
    "   * Connection details to enable the data scientists to access the contents\n",
    "   * Column details\n",
    "   * Governance zones defining the files' visibility\n",
    "   * Owner \n",
    "   * Origin\n",
    "* A file is not accessible by any of the data lake users until the cataloguing process is complete.\n",
    "* They must record lineage of each measurements file so they know which hospital it came from.\n",
    "\n",
    "They have been [manually cataloguing the measurements files](building-a-data-catalog.ipynb) for\n",
    "the first few weeks to prove the approach but now it is time to automate the process since:\n",
    "* This clinical trial is planned to run for two years.\n",
    "* There is a expected to be a ramp up of other clinical trials running simultaneously and the\n",
    "  file onboarding workload would soon become overwhelming if they continued with the manual approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "They plan to use an\n",
    "[Integration Daemon](https://egeria.odpi.org/open-metadata-implementation/admin-services/docs/concepts/integration-daemon.html)\n",
    "called **exchangeDL01** to capture the technical metadata of the files.\n",
    "Then the \n",
    "[Engine Host](https://egeria.odpi.org/open-metadata-implementation/admin-services/docs/concepts/engine-host.html)\n",
    "server called **governDL01** will manage the move of the file into the data lake,\n",
    "the augmentation of the metadata properties of the files and the creation of the lineage.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab sets up the automated onbourding process using 6 phases as shown in Figure 2:\n",

    "\n",
    "Look for the second \"Done.\" message that is displayed just after the governance servers have started.  It may take up to a minute to start up all of the servers.  If `cocoMDS2` seems to be very slow starting, check that Apache Kafka is running.  The metadata servers will wait for Kafka during start up if they are connected to a cohort.  When they are waiting in this manner, they periodically output a message on the console."
