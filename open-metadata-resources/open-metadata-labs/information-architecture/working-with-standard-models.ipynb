    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Egeria is an open source project that provides open standards and implementation libraries to connect tools, catalogs and platforms together so they can share information (called metadata) about data and the technology that supports it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this hands-on lab you will get to use Egeria to load and view a standard glossary and data model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard models are provided by specialist organizations, consortiums and other types of industry groups to capture a description of the data that is typically used in a specific scenario.  Often the model includes descriptive information as well as structural information documenting how the data is organized and linked together.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we are going to work with the Cloud Information Model (CIM) see [cloudinformationmodel.org](http://cloudinformationmodel.org).  This model covers the following subject areas:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Party – people, their roles and organizations.\n",
    "* Product – product descriptions, structures and packaging.\n",
    "* Sales Order – customer orders for goods and services.\n",
    "* Payment Method – payment methods including cards, coupons and digital wallets.\n",
    "* Payment – individual payments for goods and services.\n",
    "* Shipment – shipment of goods and services to the customer to fulfil an order.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means the CIM can provide common data structures for new services spanning customer and employee interaction around typical commercial activities such as buying and selling of goods and services.\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation behind the cloud information model is to support organizations that are transforming their digital services to run on a variety of cloud platforms and with their own data centres.  Often, they are dealing with systems built on many different generations of technology, with data distributed amongst them.  The CIM provides a common language to describe the different types of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is extremely valuable to the open metadata and governance ecosystem with its focus on building an open and transparent view of data across an organization. \n",
    "\n",
    "This lab notebook enables you to explore the contents of the CIM and explains how it can help you when setting up your own open metadata and governance ecosystem.\n"

They see that they will not need to keep so much inventory since orders are per patient and just when needed.  All parties agree, however, that they need to protect the privacy of the patients and medical staff involved and not accidentally leak personal details through the order fulfillment process.\n",
