    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "ODPi Egeria is an open source project that provides open standards and implementation libraries to connect tools,\n",
    "catalogs and platforms together so they can share information about data and technology (called metadata).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this hands-on lab you will get a chance to run an Egeria metadata server, configure discovery services in a discovery engine and run the discovery engine in a discovery server.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is open discovery?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Metadata discovery](https://egeria.odpi.org/open-metadata-publication/website/metadata-discovery/) is the\n",
    "ability to automatically analyze and create metadata about assets.  ODPi Egeria provides an [Open Discovery Framework (ODF)](https://egeria.odpi.org/open-metadata-implementation/frameworks/open-discovery-framework/) that defines open interfaces for components that implement specific types of metadata discovery.   These components can then be called from tools offered by different vendors through the open APIs.\n",
    "We call this ability to invoke metadata discovery components from many different vendor tools, **open discovery**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Open Discovery Framework (ODF) provides standard interfaces for **discovery services**.  This is the ODF\n",
    "name for the metadata discovery components.  The ODF interfaces control how a discovery service is started and stopped, how it can access the existing metadata about an asset, and store any additional information about the asset that it discovers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Discovery services are grouped together into a useful collection of capability called a **discovery engine**. The same discovery service may be used in multiple discovery engines.\n",
    "\n",
    "ODPi Egeria provides a governance server called the **discovery server** that can host one or more discovery engines.  The discovery server has APIs to call the discovery engines and their services inside to drive the analysis a specific asset, and then to view the results.  The discovery server can also scan through all assets, running specific analysis on any it finds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discovery servers tend to be paired and deployed close to the data platforms they are analyzing because the discovery process makes many calls to access the content of the asset.  It is not uncommon for an organization to deploy multiple discovery servers if their data is distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The discovery server connects to a metadata server to retreive and store metadata about the asset.  It uses the Discovery Engine OMAS APIs and events of the metadata server.\n",
    "A single metadata server can support many discovery servers.\n",
    "The Discovery Engine OMAS also supports the\n",
    "maintenance of the discovery services' and discovery engines' definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure 1](../images/discovery-servers.png)\n",
    "> **Figure 1:** Discovery server deployments\n",
    "\n",
    "A particular discovery engine may be assigned to run in multiple discovery servers. This is useful if the type of\n",
    "data it is able to analyze is distributed across different locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercises that follow take you through the process of defining discovery engines and services, verifying that\n",
    "they are available in the discovery server and then running discovery requests against various assets.\n"
