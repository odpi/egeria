# Docker Compose script to support Egeria labs and tutorials

The docker-compose environment for running an Egeria lab setup is **now deprecated**

The [Kubernetes based Helm Charts](https://odpi.github.io/egeria-charts) are now preferred

You can still access the example in this directory, including the [README](README_deprecated.md) . However they are no longer tested and may not be updated with later content.

This content will be removed entirely in future.
