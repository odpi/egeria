# docker

This directory contains docker build scripts & assets for creating any images
needed for Egeria demos & deployments, where such assets do not exist on known
repositories.

## Building

Docker images are not built by default. They can be built manually.

To build, run the following *from within this same directory* (running it at the root level of the
project will needlessly build the entire Egeria project first):

```bash
$ mvn -Ddocker -Ddocker.repo=odpi -Ddocker.registry=localhost:5000 clean install
```

In this example:

- The `-Ddocker` tells maven (indirectly) to activate the docker profile. This is how the build is enabled since it is
    disabled by default, since many will not have docker or want to incur the time to rebuild the images. Indirectly
    refers to the fact we are setting a property, which then causes the profile activation in a submodule.
- The `-Ddocker.repo=` specifies the repository to use, for docker hub this is usually your username (for individuals).
    There is no default and if this is not supplied the build will exit with an error.
- `deploy` is needed since the pushing of images is currently bound to this stage of the maven lifecycle.
- The `-Ddocker.registry=` can be used to specify an alternative container registry. For example, a local or
    corporate registry, or perhaps a public cloud service. The value in the example above uses a
    [local Docker registry](https://docs.docker.com/registry/deploying/); you could also use `registry-1.docker.io`
    for the public docker hub when you also change the `docker.repo` setting to a resource to which you have write
    access.

## Limitations

- All docker builds will currently set the tag (version) to be the same as the maven version (eg. 3.13-SNAPSHOT). This
    means that when testing it is imperative to always force-pull fresh images, or an old version may be used. For
    example, when using kubernetes ensure `imagePullPolicy = 'Always'`. Previously every single change was versioned,
    but this led to significant overhead in storage as well as constant changes in the source code just to do a rebuild.
- If `DOCKER_HOST` is set to a remote host connecton using ssh, the docker build may fail. Refer to
    https://github.com/spotify/dockerfile-maven/issues/272 for further information.
- If building on MacOS, the OSX credential store is not supported for docker logins (which is needed to push an image
    to the repo). To workaround this remove the line `"credsStore": "osxkeychain",` from `~/.docker/config.json` and
    reissue `docker login`. See https://github.com/spotify/dockerfile-maven/issues/273 for further information.
