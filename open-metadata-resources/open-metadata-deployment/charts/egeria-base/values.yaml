# --- General Egeria configuration ---
egeria:
  # Set to INFO, WARNING, DEBUG if needed
  logging: 
  version: "2.10-SNAPSHOT"
  repositoryType: "local-graph-repository"
  debug: false
  persistence: true
  # The userid used for admin ops (no security enabled by default)
  user: garygeeke
  # The name of the servers to provision on the platform
  serverName: mds1
  viewServerName: view1
  # Organization name for multi-tenant UI
  viewOrg: org
  # Cohort name
  cohort: mds
  # Set to override the k8s storage class for persistent volume claim
  storageClass:
  # Default to 8GB
  storageSize: 8Gi

# --- Exposing/setup of network services ---
service:
  # Change this to 'NodePort' if you want externalized addresses for our services via a k8s NodePort.
  # If not, expose the service manually after deployment ie using a LoadBalancer
  #
  # For example to expose the egeria lab stateful set you might use:
  # kubectl expose odpi-egeria-lab-dev --name egeria-dev
  type: ClusterIP
  #type: NodePort
  nodeport:
    platform: 31080
    presentation: 31091
    platformdebug: 31005

# Standard helm best practice
rbac:
  # Specifies whether RBAC resources should be created
  create: true

serviceAccount:
  # Specifies whether a ServiceAccount should be created
  create: true
  # The name of the ServiceAccount to use.
  # If not set and create is true, a name is generated using the fullname template
  name:

# Specific processing features 
options:
  jobs:
    config:
      # Timeout for configuration job
      backOffLimit: 60
      # Default will be true, but during dev set to false
      # This setting will control if the k8s job (and hence pod/logs) are deleted after egeria configuration
      # Set to false to assist in debugging 
      jobdelete: true    

# --- Docker image sources ---

# Defaults for the images (can be overridden here or individually, see comment below)
# Note for egeria provided images we use the version specified above
imageDefaults:
  registry: docker.io
  namespace: odpi
  tag: latest
  pullPolicy: Always

# The following section defines all of the DOCKER images being used by this chart. Normally they should be left as is,
# but are exposed here in case the user wishes to extend. By default, each will use the 'imageDefaults' above, but
# these can be individually overridden for each image, if desired, by providing a subkey for 'namespace', 'tag' or
# 'pullPolicy' with the value to use for the override (if you want to use the public Docker registry, use
# 'docker.io/library' as the registry override, and set namespace to be your user or organization id).
#
#  To build from egeria source - (example)
#  mvn clean install -Ddocker -Ddocker.registry=localhost:5000 -Ddocker.repo=odpi
image:
  egeria:

# --- Kafka Configuration ---

# When using the k8s-internal Kafka (from Bitnami), enable auto-topic creation and minimize the footprint
# See https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/kafka for more info
kafka:
    #volumePermissions:
    #enabled: true
    securityContext:
        enabled: false
    zookeeper:
        persistence: 
            enabled: true
    persistence: 
        enabled: true
    logpersistence: 
        enabled: true
    #can be enabled if external kafka access is required
    #service:
        #nodeport: 30092

# Additional configuration notes:
#
# -- We assume we are always providing our own kafka/zookeeper (the VDC chart is an example of this being configurable)
# -- the kafka topic root is not configurable - may be needed to be configurable if we change the above
# -- always uses graph repo - inmemory doesn't make sense for a persistent environment
