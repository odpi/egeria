# The following section defines all of the DOCKER images being used by this chart. Normally they should be left as is,

# these can be individually overridden for each image, if desired, by providing a subkey for 'namespace', 'tag' or
# 'pullPolicy' with the value to use for the override (if you want to use the public Docker registry, use
# 'docker.io/library' as the registry override, and set namespace to be your user or organization id).
