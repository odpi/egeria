ODPi Egeria lab tutorial 
---

The Egeria tutorials have now been deployed to Kubernetes.
It may take a minute or so for everything to start up.

Open your web browser and go to addressofmycluster:{{ .Values.service.nodeport.jupyter }} to
get started

You may need to contact your cluster admin, or read your cloud provider helptext to understand
the correct 'addressofmycluster' to use.

If you experience problems, check memory consumption on your nodes. A minimum of
a 3 node cluster, 2GB per node; or a desktop environment with 6GB dedicated is recommended.

Please provide any feeback via a github issue at https://github.com/odpi/egeria or 
join us on slack via https://http://slack.lfai.foundation
