# Learning about Egeria

Egeria is a big project tackling a complex problem.
The [Egeria Dojo](egeria-dojo) provides guided learning to help you get up to
speed quickly with different topics.  It has 3 parts:

* Learn how to set up and run Egeria on you own machine.
* Learn how to make a contribution to Egeria
* Learn how to become either an advocate or a maintainer

It is organized so you can work through it as an intensive 3 day course, or
work at you own pace, dipping in and out as the interest takes you.

In addition, there are the [Hands on Labs](../open-metadata-labs).
These provide an interactive environment that allow you to
experiment with different capabilities of Egeria.
