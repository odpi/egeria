# Running Egeria natively

These technologies are what Egeria itself uses to operate. They are included when using the
self-contained environments, but they can also be installed and run natively (directly)
on your system.

Just be aware that running them natively on your system will require the additional effort of downloading, installing,
configuring and operating each one -- which the self-contained environments largely take care of for you. To make use
of the latest Egeria software, you will likely also need to be familiar with how to [build Egeria](building.md) in
order to use it natively.

Follow the [OMAG Server Platform tutorial](../omag-server-tutorial/task-starting-the-omag-server-platform.md)
for instructions on how to set up and run a platform yourself.
You need to start four OMAG Server Platforms at the following URLs - remembering to use the `-Dserver.port=nnnn` option:

- `https://localhost:9443`
- `https://localhost:9444`
- `https://localhost:9445`
- `https://localhost:9446`

## Java

[Java](https://www.java.com) is a relatively mature object-oriented programming language that was
originally designed to be able to easily run programs across a number of different computer systems.

The Egeria project itself is primarily written in Java, and therefore a Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
is the most basic component needed in order to run Egeria.

You can either run such an environment directly on your system, or you can use one of the options
below to run a self-contained environment on top of your system.

You can check if you have a JRE available by running the command `java -version` from the command-line.

If not, and you prefer to run it directly rather than via one of the options outlined below,
Java can be installed by:

1. Downloading the OpenJDK JRE or JDK from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net). Java 11 is required. Hotspot is tested, J9 should work.
1. Running the installer that is downloaded.

Alternatively you may wish to install from your package manager such as 'homebrew' on MacOS.

## Apache Kafka

[Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org) is used by Egeria as an event bus.

There is a [QuickStart Guide provided by Kafka itself](https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart) covering
installation and basic usage.

For the tutorials, the Kafka server needs to be running a `PLAINTEXT` listener on `localhost:9092`. From the directory
where Kafka is installed, check the `config/server.properties` file so that the `listeners` and `advertised.listeners`
are setup as follows:

```text
listeners=PLAINTEXT://localhost:9092
advertised.listeners=PLAINTEXT://localhost:5092
```

To restart Kafka after making this update, change into Kafka's `bin` directory and issue the following commands:

```bash
$ ./zookeeper-server-start.sh ../config/zookeeper.properties &
$ ./kafka-server-start.sh ../config/server.properties &
```

You may alternatively wish to install kafka/zookeeper using a package manager such as 'homebrew' on MacOS.
## Apache ZooKeeper

[Apache ZooKeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org) is used by Apache Kafka for maintaining certain configuration
information. It is therefore typically a pre-requisite to using Apache Kafka.

The [QuickStart Guide provided by Kafka itself](https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart) includes quick-and-dirty
instructions on running a minimal ZooKeeper server necessary for Kafka's use. For more detailed information,
you will want to read the [ZooKeeper Getting Started Guide](https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/current/zookeeperStarted.html).

## Jupyter

[Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) provides tools for interactive computing. In particular, we use
Jupyter Notebooks to provide an interactive tutorial that shows rich instructions, allows you to run
code, and to see the output all in the same interface.

Our notebooks are found under open-metadata-resources/open-metadata-labs/ - either start jupyter with this as the current
directory, or navigate to it in the web ui. (this is automatic when using the other execution options).
