# Building and developing Egeria

These technologies are needed in order to build and develop Egeria.

If you simply want to try out and explore Egeria, or if you find yourself lost in all of these technologies,
choose one of the [self-contained environments](README.md) instead.

## Supported Platforms

Egeria currently supports building on *nix, Linux & Linux-like operating systems such as MacOS.

Our official build pipelines are based on x86_64 architecture, but it is expected other architectures would build ok, subject
to the availablility of the required tools and interpreters/jvms/runtimes ie Java, Python, Docker/containerd/k8s etc.

On Windows, you should use [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) Version 2 or above, and install 
a Linux distribution such as Ubuntu. This avoids issues we have seen with path seperators, symbolic links, slow I/O performance, long pathnames. 

Some IDEs such as JetBrains IntelliJ and Microsoft VisualCode will run the GUI in Windows natively, and then use a linux environment
(via WSL2 - which uses a real Linux kernel) to perform build and execution
## Git

Git is an open source version control system.  It is what we use to:

- track changes to the underlying Egeria code as the project evolves
- track issues and enhancements, and link these back to the code changes that resolve them
- collaborate on and review the issues, enhancements and code changes

As a result, it gives us a definitive source for the latest and greatest source code for
Egeria itself, its history, and the rationale behind various decisions that are made over
time.

In our [Downloading Egeria from GitHub tutorial](../building-egeria-tutorial/task-downloading-egeria-source.md),
when you are asked to do a `git clone https://github.com/odpi/egeria.git`, what you are
telling your own computer to do is to create a local copy of our source code repository.
It is this local copy that you can then use (locally) to build Egeria itself.

You can check whether it is installed on your system by running `git --version` from the command-line.

Git can be installed:

- On MacOS, as part of the **Xcode** suite (running `git --version` will prompt you to install it if it is not already
installed).
- On Linux operating systems, by using your distribution's package manager (`yum install git`, `apt-get install git`, etc).
- On Windows, you should use [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) Version 2 or above, install an appropriate Linux distribution, and follow
  the instructions for Linux.

[GitHub provides some great introductory guides](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/).

## Java

Because Egeria is written in Java, you will need a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed in order to build
Egeria. The JDK can also act as the runtime environment (JRE) mentioned in [running Egeria natively](running-natively.md).

There are various JDKs available, and you may even have one pre-installed on your system. You can check
by running the command `java -version` from the command-line.

Java can be installed by:

1. Downloading the **OpenJDK 11 (LTS) HotSpot** JVM from [Adoptium](https://adoptopenjdk.net).
1. Running the installer that is downloaded.

## Apache Maven

[Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org) is a tool to describe and manage the technical aspects of a
software project. For example, it can be used to define various dependencies a project like Egeria has on
other pre-existing software projects or libraries. This information can then be used during the build
process to ensure that all of the necessary software is bundled together.

When you are asked to run `mvn clean install` in the [Building the Egeria Source tutorial](../building-egeria-tutorial/task-building-egeria-source.md),
you are instructing Maven to go through the Egeria source code and build the project: including all of these
external libraries and dependencies (including downloading them automatically, when needed).

You can check if Maven installed by running the command `mvn --version` from the command-line.

Maven can be installed:

- On MacOS, by first installing the [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh) package manager and then running
`brew install maven` from the command-line.
- On Linux operating systems, by using your distribution's package manager (`yum install maven`, `apt-get install maven`, etc).
- On Windows, you should use [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) Version 2 or above, install an appropriate Linux distribution, and follow
  the instructions for Linux.
  
Ensure you are using version 3.5.0 or higher in order to build Egeria.
