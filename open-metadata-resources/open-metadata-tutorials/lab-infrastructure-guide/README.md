# Guide to Running Egeria for the Hands on Labs

There are a number of approaches to running the environment used in
the [hands on labs](../../open-metadata-labs).

If you only want to get the environment running for the hands on labs:

* [Running Egeria in a self-contained environment using Kubernetes](running-kubernetes.md).

If you want to learn more about setting up egeria and its related technologies,
then this is the option for you ...

* [Running the Egeria ecosystem natively](running-natively.md).

## Further information

If you are entirely new to technologies like Git, Java, Maven, Kafka, ZooKeeper, Jupyter, Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, etc
the [Egeria Dojo](../egeria-dojo) provides self-paced education that covers these technologies
in the context of Egeria.
