# Creating an Issue on GitHub

Every contribution begins with a `git issue`.
Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/odpi/egeria) and click on the second tab marked `Issues`.

![GitHub New Issue Button](../../../developer-resources/tools/git-hub-new-issue-button.png#pagewidth)
----

Enter a meaningful title and description.  This will help the maintainers understand your contribution
and speed up the process to include it.
If you are participating on the dojo you can use a title of `Create my postcard file for Egeria Dojo`
and description of
```md
This is a change to Egeria that is part of the Egeria Dojo session
[Making a contribution to Egeria - Step-by-Step](https://egeria.odpi.org/open-metadata-resources/open-metadata-tutorials/egeria-dojo/egeria-dojo-day-2-3-contribution-to-egeria.html).
It will create a new markdown file in `open-metadata-resources/open-metadata-tutorials/egeria-dojo/egeria-dojo-postcards` and link it to the readme.
```
Notice that it is possible to use [Markdown](../../../developer-resources/tools/Markdown.md)
tags to create highlights and links to content to explain what you are doing.

When you are happy with your text, click on `Submit new Issue`.  A new issue is created and
assigned a new number - `#3091` in this example.
Make a note of this issue number because you will need it later.
