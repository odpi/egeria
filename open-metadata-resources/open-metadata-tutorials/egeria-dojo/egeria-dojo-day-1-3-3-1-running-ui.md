# Running User Interfaces (UIs)

In this session, you will learn about the user interfaces provided by Egeria.

![Running UI Content](egeria-dojo-day-1-3-3-1-running-ui.png)

Egeria has two User Interfaces in development at the moment, each focused at different
types of organization.

The **EgeriaUIPlatform** provides a user interface for a mature organization that has already invested in a metadata
capability and is using Egeria to integrate tools into their metadata repository plus add advanced features.

The second UI makes use of view servers and a thin presentation server.  It is multi-tenant and is
focused on supporting all aspects of an organization's metadata integration and governance needs.

Since these capabilities are still in development, this session will be a demonstration of the two UIs we have.
At a later date, the dojo will be updated to include exercises where you can run them yourselves.
