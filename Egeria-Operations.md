# Egeria Operations

The Egeria project provides content (standards, data, code and documentation) that is intended for wide consumption
across many types of organizations - from those that rely on data in their operation - to organizations that have products
or technology designed to help manage data and its related processing.

A project of this scope requires input from a wide range of subject-matter experts with different backgrounds and allegiances.
As such we need a set of principles, roles and operating practices to ensure the results of our contributions are useful,
have high quality and are widely consumable.

The [Operations Guide](https://egeria-project.org/guides/project-operations/) has moved to the new [Documentation Site](https://egeria-project.org/guides/project-operations/).
