# Why is this project called "Egeria"?

![Egeria Logo](../../../assets/img/egeria2.png#pagewidth)

The ideas behind Egeria came from the project founders' extensive work in
building big data solutions.  At that time, these were
often called **data lakes** or **data reservoirs**.

This publication 
[The Journey Continues: From Data Lake to Data-Driven Organization](https://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redpapers/pdfs/redp5486.pdf)
described the need for open metadata.

The original plan was to extend [Apache Atlas](http://atlas.apache.org)
to support the open metadata protocols.  However, the open metadata function
proved too big to be an add-on to Atlas and we agreed with the
Atlas team to start a new project for open metadata.

Then there was the question of what to call the new project.
The name needed to be available for trademark and a member of the
community came up with "Egeria".

Egeria was a Roman Water Nymph and a wise counselor.
(See [Wikipedia for more details](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egeria_%28mythology%29 )).
The water theme seemed to fit with the data lake origin and since
the Egeria technology shares knowledge between communities that
use different tools, the notion of a "counselor" seemed to fit as well.
