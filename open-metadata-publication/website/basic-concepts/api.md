# Application Programming Interface (API)

An API is a well-defined interface that can be called from a remote process.
There are many styles and protocols available to enable calls to APIs.  The most popular at the moment is
the [REST API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) style that piggy-backs on top of
the HTTP protocol that powers the Internet.  Egeria makes extensive use of REST APIs.


## Further information

Details of the different types of APIs provided by Egeria can be found in the [Developer Guide](../developer-guide).
In addition, it is possible to automatically catalog details of the APIs that your organization uses:
