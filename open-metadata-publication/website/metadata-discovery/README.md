# Metadata Discovery

Metadata discovery is an automated process that extracts metadata about an
[asset](../../../open-metadata-implementation/access-services/docs/concepts/assets).
This metadata may be:
* embedded within the asset 
  * (for example a digital photograph has embedded metadata), or
* managed by the platform that is hosting the asset
  * (for example, a relational database platform maintains
schema information about the data store in its databases) or
* determined by analysing the content of the asset
  * (for example a metadata
discovery tool may analyse the data content to determine the types and range of values it contains and,
maybe determine a quality score for the data).

Some metadata discovery may occur when the asset is first cataloged.
For example, the schema of an asset may be stored through the
[Data Manager OMAS](../../../open-metadata-implementation/access-services/data-manager) API.
This schema may have been automatically extracted by a
metadata extractor connector hosted in Egeria's Open Metadata Integration Services like [Database Integrator](../../../open-metadata-implementation/integration-services/database-integrator) or [Files Integrator](../../../open-metadata-implementation/integration-services/files-integrator) daemon.

Egeria also supports more advanced metadata discovery.

The [Open Discovery Framework (ODF)](../../../open-metadata-implementation/frameworks/open-discovery-framework)
has open APIs that define how automated discovery services
can be managed and interact with an open metadata repository.
The metadata repository interfaces provide the metadata discovery service
with:
 * the ability to manage discovery configuration,
 * a search function to locate assets in the metadata repository,
 * access all of the metadata known about each asset including its connector and
 * the ability to record the results of its analysis.

This metadata repository interface for metadata discovery tools is
implemented by the
[Discovery Engine OMAS](../../../open-metadata-implementation/access-services/discovery-engine).

Egeria is also able to host automated metadata discovery services
that implement the ODF interfaces in its
[Asset Analysis OMES](../../../open-metadata-implementation/engine-services/asset-analysis).
