The **Egeria Docker Image** is built daily and pushed to
[DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/odpi/egeria).  It contains an OMAG Server Platform.
You can down load it an use it in your own container environments.

The **Kubernetes Helm Charts** and **Docker compose scripts** make use of the
docker image to create a rich Egeria deployment used in the hands on labs.
Their they are located in the [open-metadata-deployment](../../../open-metadata-resources/open-metadata-deployment) module
and their use is described in [the setting up instructions](../../../open-metadata-resources/open-metadata-labs) of the hands on labs.

The **Kubernetes Operators** are in development.  They will provide an easy way to control an
Egeria deployment running on Kubernetes.
