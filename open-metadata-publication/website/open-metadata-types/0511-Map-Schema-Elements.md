# 0511 Map Schema Elements

Maps hold the relationship between pairs of values.  Often they
are used to show how one value (the domain) can be mapped to another
value (the range).

The **MapSchemaType** describes the types of the values being mapped.
The **MapFromElementType** relationship describes the domain type and
the **MapToElementType** relationship describes the range type.

The relationships start from [SchemaElement](0501-Schema-Elements.md)
rather than MapSchemaType since the schema type may be
located in the the [TypeEmbeddedAttribute classification](0505-Schema-Attributes.md)
