# 0420 Governance Controls

Governance is enabled through People, Process and Technology.
These are controlled through a combination of technical controls (implemented IT function) and organizational controls (training, responsibility, buddy-checking etc).

## Further Information

* Governance controls are types of **GovernanceDefinitions** which are located in model [0401](0401-Governance-Definitions.md).
  The governance policies are defined in model [0415](0415-Governance-Responses.md).

* The [Governance Program OMAS](../../../open-metadata-implementation/access-services/governance-program)
  provides support for defining governance policies through its **GovernancePolicyMakingInterface**.

       * [0460 Governance Execution Points](0460-Governance-Execution-Points.md) - describe classifications for software components that link them to a technical control.
       * [0461 Governance Action Engines](0461-Governance-Engines.md) - support the execution of technical controls.
       * [0462 Governance Action Types](0462-Governance-Action-Types.md) - provide the choreography of the execution of technical controls.
     * [0440 Organizational Controls](0440-Organizational-Controls.md) - identity governance roles and manual procedures (such as approvals) that implement a governance control.
