# 0482 Certifications

Many regulations and industry bodies define certifications
that can confirm a level of support, capability or competence
in an aspect of a digital organization’s operation.
Having certifications may be necessary to operating legally
or may be a business advantage.

The certifications awarded can be captured in the metadata
repository to enable both use and management of the
certification process.
