# 0150 Feedback

An important principle of good metadata it to be continually
capturing the experience of subject matter experts.
The feedback model captures comments and ratings from subject matter experts.

![UML](0150-Feedback.png#pagewidth)

Comments and ratings are a key mechanism for providing
feedback on the metadata definitions by any user.  

**Note:** that because comments inherit from [Referenceable](0010-Base-Model.md) they can be tagged, rated and commented on.
