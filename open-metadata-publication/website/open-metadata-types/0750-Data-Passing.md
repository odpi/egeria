# 0750 Data Passing

Describes relationships that show where data and control is passed between processes and assets.
These relationships show the structure of the data processing.
They can link [Assets](0010-Base-Model.md), or [Ports](0217-Ports.md) or [SchemaAttributes](0505-Schema-Attributes.md)
depending on the level of detail that is known.

These relationships are then overlaid by the [LineageMapping](0770-Lineage-Mapping.md) relationship to
show which are significant for lineage.
