Linked media types describe the simple
structures that are used repeatedly in open metadata to connect it to
documents and entities in other types of repositories.

* **ExternalReference**s link metadata to elements in external repositories.

* **RelatedMedia** such as images allow an icon,
thumbnail and larger images to be associated with a metadata element. 
They are intended to be displayed with the metadata content.
These images enrich the description of the object and may include,
for example, design drawings, photographs or illustrations of the
component in action.
