# 0536 API Schemas

APIs exchange data structures and commands.
The schema of the API is its interface definition.
It is an access point for data and so it is important to
understand and control what data is passing over an API.
Model 0536 shows the structure of an API schema.
The top level schema for the API lists the operations.
Under that, each operation defines its requests and responses.
