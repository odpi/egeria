# 0137 Actions for People

In an ideal world, most governance activity is automated by the
[governance engines](0461-Governance-Engines.md).
However there are inevitably actions that require a person to do.
An item of work for a person is described in a ToDo.

Figure 1 captures the ToDo entity and its originator, along
with the people assigned to work on it and the elements that should be worked on as
part of the activity.
