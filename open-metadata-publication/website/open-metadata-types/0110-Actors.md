# 0110 Actors

Most metadata repositories are run in a secure mode
requiring incoming requests to include the requesterâ€™s
security credentials.
Therefore we have an identifier for each unique logged on
security identity (aka userId).
This identity is recorded with specific entities and
relationships when they are created or updated.
The userId for a server is also captured in the metadata
model (see [0040 Servers in Area 0](0040-Software-Servers.md))
so it is possible to
correlate the actions of a data processing server with
changes to the metadata. 

Figure 1 captures how people and teams are represented.

> Figure 1: Collecting information about people and teams

**UserIdentity** provides a structure for storing the security
authentication information about a person.
Initially we have a simple string for the userId - but this
could be extended to include more sophisticated
identification information.

An **ActorProfile** describes the actual person, or possibly
team if group userIds are being used, that is working either
with the data assets or with the metadata directly.
The profile is a record to add additional information about
the person or engine that is making the requests.
They may have more than one UserIdentity.

Actors are associated with the new metadata that they
create and comment on via their user identities.
More information about the person behind the user
identity is available through the ActorProfile.
This separation is maintained because the user identity
is the only information available on calls to the metadata
repository.  The ActorProfile is used to aggregate the
activity of the individual or team
(or IT infrastructure - see [ITProfile](0117-IT-Profiles.md)).
This includes crowd-sourcing and project participation.
