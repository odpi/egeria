# 0566 Design Model Organization

In this model we define the top-level **Design Model** that
is the anchor for a collection of related
[design model elements](0565-Design-Model-Elements.md).

Design models can get quite large so it helps the software architects and
developers to be able to organize the content of the models into
related groups.  These groups can themselves be organized into a hierarchy.
