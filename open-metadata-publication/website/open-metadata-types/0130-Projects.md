# 0130 Projects

Projects are used to organize a specific activity.
The project is used to control the use of resources and
associated costs so they are used appropriately in order
to successfully achieve the project's goals. 

![UML](0130-Projects.png#pagewidth)

Projects organize resources to build new capability or improve existing capability.
Related projects can be organized into campaigns.
Small items of work, typically performed by a single person,
can be defined as tasks for a project.

Notice that the project acts as an anchor for
collections of resources that the project is using.
Since it is a Referenceable, it can have links to external URLs,
such as the project home page, project plan or APIs
as well as images (see [0015 Linked Media Types](0015-Linked-Media-Types.md) in Area 0).

The description attribute should be used instead of the scopeDescription in ProjectScope; the 
scopeDescription attribute has been deprecated.
