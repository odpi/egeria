# 0205 Connection Linkage

The purpose of a [connector](../../../open-metadata-implementation/frameworks/open-connector-framework/docs/concepts/connector.md)
is to access the content and related properties (metadata) about an
[Asset](../../../open-metadata-implementation/access-services/docs/concepts/assets/README.md) owned or used by an organization.

In order for the connector to provide details of the know properties of an Asset, the open metadata
types support a relationship between a [Connection](../../../open-metadata-implementation/frameworks/open-connector-framework/docs/concepts/connection.md) and
the Asset.

Notice that the connection can only be associated with one asset, although an Asset may support multiple
connections, each providing a different class of service, or security permissions to the consumer.

In addition, some connectors are virtual connectors - by that we mean they implement an abstraction to a business level asset
and internally use one of more technical connectors as part of their implementation.
The metadata repository can reflect these connection relationships using a **VirtualConnection**.
