# Area 7 Models - Lineage

Lineage basically describes the origin of something such as an asset,
component or data values.

Area 7 provides the structures for adding context to asset definitions to
help explain their origin.  The aim is to provide information that allows a consumer of data
to be sure they are looking at the right data from an authoritative source and the intermediate
processing is correct.
