# 0540 Data Classes

Data classes provide the specification of a logical data type.
This goes beyond the type used to store the data value and
includes a specification of the values that are found in this
logical type.  For example, a credit card number is typically
stored as a string.  However it has a well defined pattern of
four groups of four digits.  The data class allows the capture of
the specification of a credit card number type that can be used
by discovery engines to find more information out about
the data values within an Asset.
