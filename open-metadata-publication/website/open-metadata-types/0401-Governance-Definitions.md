# 0401 Governance Definitions

The world of governance is divided into different governance domains that focus on a specific set of assets or activities.
Egeria aims to unify the metadata and governance activity across
these governance domains.

**GovernanceDomain** provides a default list of the
different types of governance domains that can be unified by Egeria.
Notice that there are obvious overlaps and linkages between the domains:

* DATA - the governance of data and its use.
* PRIVACY - the support for data privacy.
* SECURITY - the governance that ensures IT systems and the data they hold are secure.
* IT_INFRASTRUCTURE - the governance of the configuration and management of IT infrastructure and the software that runs on it.
* SOFTWARE_DEVELOPMENT - the governance of the software development lifecycle.
* CORPORATE - the governance of the organization as a legal entity.
* ASSET_MANAGEMENT - the governance of physical assets.

The **GovernanceDomainDescription** provides the definition of a governance domain.
You can choose to define your own or use the standard set that are defined by **GovernanceDomain**.
Related governance domains can be grouped into **GovernanceDomainSets**.

The role of leader of a governance domain is represented as a **GovernanceOfficer**.

**GovernanceDefinition** describes an aspect of a governance program.
They are authored in the metadata repository.  
They inherit from [Referenceable](0010-Base-Model.md),
which means they have a unique identifier and link to external references for more information.

**GovernedBy** links the governance definitions to the elements they are governing.

## Further Information

* The governance definitions are organized into specific subtypes and linked together to provide a complete
  description of the governance program.  The types for these more specialized definitions can be found
  on the following pages:
  
  * [0405 Governance Drivers](0405-Governance-Drivers.md) - describe the motivations behind the governance program.
  * [0415 Governance Responses](0415-Governance-Responses.md) - describe the policies that support each of the drivers.
  * [0420 Governance Controls](0420-Governance-Controls.md) - describe how the policies will be implemented.
     * [0430 Technical Controls](0430-Technical-Controls.md) - describe automated behaviour that implements a governance control.
       * [0438 Naming Standards](0438-Naming-Standards.md) - defines naming standard rules.
       * [0460 Governance Execution Points](0460-Governance-Execution-Points.md) - describe classifications for software components that link them to a technical control.
       * [0461 Governance Action Engines](0461-Governance-Engines.md) - support the execution of technical controls.
       * [0462 Governance Action Types](0462-Governance-Action-Types.md) - provide the choreography of the execution of technical controls.
     * [0440 Organizational Controls](0440-Organizational-Controls.md) - identity governance roles and manual procedures (such as approvals) that implement a governance control.
       * [0445 Governance Roles](0445-Governance-Roles.md) - define governance roles and the people associated with them.
  * [0481 License Types](0481-Licenses.md) - terms and conditions used in rights management.
  * [0482 Certification Types](0482-Certifications.md) - types of certifications used to shw compliance to a specific governance requirement.
  * [0485 Data Processing Purposes](0485-Data-Processing-Purposes.md) - definitions of purposes used in data privacy regulations.

* The [Governance Program OMAS](../../../open-metadata-implementation/access-services/governance-program)
  provides the APIs for maintaining the definitions of the governance domains, governance definitions and
  governance officers. It uses the **GovernedBy** relationship to link governance definitions 
  with [subject area definitions](0425-Subject-Areas.md) and
  [governance zone definitions](0424-Governance-Zones.md).
  
* The [Asset Manager OMAS](../../../open-metadata-implementation/access-services/asset-manager) supports the
  exchange of governance definitions with third party asset managers and governance tools as well as the
  use of the **GovernedBy** relationship through its **Governance Exchange Interface**.
