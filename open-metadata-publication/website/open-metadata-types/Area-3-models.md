# Area 3 Models - Glossary and Semantics

Area 3 describes the glossary.

This enables the definition of the terminology used in an organization.
This terminology reflects the processing and the data needed in its operations.

The glossary is made up of terms, each one describing a word or short phrase.
The terms can be linked together to show the relationships
between different types of terminology.

Most glossary terms are created through a manual process by subject matter experts.
They may be part of a trade or industry organization, or experts within the business.
This investment is typically made using a specialist tool and then replicated automatically into other metadata
repositories.

There can be multiple glossaries in the metadata repositories.  
Each glossary owns a set of glossary terms and (optionally) a category hierarchy.  Glossary terms can be linked into none, one or many categories, from any glossary.  Similarly, terms from different glossaries may have relationships linking them together.
This is the definitions of terms and concepts and how
they relate to one another.

Linking the concepts/terms defined in the glossary
to the data assets in [Area 2](Area-2-models.md), defines the meaning of the
data that is managed by the data assets.
This is a key relationship that helps people locate and
understand the data assets they are working with.
