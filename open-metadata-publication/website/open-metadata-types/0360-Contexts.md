# 0360 Contexts

The Context model defines a classification for a
glossary term that indicates it defines a context,
and a relationship called **UsedInContext** to link terms that are relevant in that context.

Glossary Terms that are relevant in that context are linked to the context definition term using the UsedInContext relationship.
