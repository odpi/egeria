# 0503 Asset Schema

Model 0503 shows the relationship between an [Asset](0010-Base-Model.md)
and a [Schema Element](0501-Schema-Elements.md).

A physical data store may be made up of a hierarchy of Assets.
Each of these Assets may point to the appropriate SchemaElements which
are also typically organized in a hierarchy.
Thus we can work with both assets and schema at different
levels of granularity.
