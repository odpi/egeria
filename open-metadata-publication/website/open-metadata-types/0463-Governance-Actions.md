# 0463 Governance Actions

A **GovernanceAction** describes some processing that is part of the governance
of an organization's asset or the metadata tht describes them.

The creation of a GovernanceAction typically triggers
services in the [governance engines](../../../open-metadata-implementation/admin-services/docs/concepts/engine-host.md).
As the services run, they add information to the GovernanceAction describing the
activities run and the actions taken against specific resources (see **TargetForAction**).
Once the action is complete,
the GovernanceAction acts as an audit record for the actions taken.

The **GovernanceActionExecutor** identifies the governance engine
that will run the service that will execute the action.  The specific service is
identified by the requestType property.
The governance engine is shown as a [SoftwareServerCapability](0042-Software-Server-Capabilities.md)
but is typically either a [DiscoveryEngine](0601-Open-Discovery-Engine.md) or
a [GovernanceActionEngine](0461-Governance-Engines.md).

The **GovernanceActionRequestSource** links the first GovernanceAction
in a chain to the cause/originator of the action.  This could be, for example,
a [GovernanceProcess](0430-Technical-Controls.md) or a
[RequestForActionAnnotation](0690-Request-for-Action.md).

The GovernanceAction is also linked to
any follow on activities through the **NextGovernanceAction**
relationship so it is possible to trace through a chain of actions.
The **guard** describes the output guard from the previous action(s)
that will trigger the next action(s).  
If the guard is mandatory (ie **mandatoryGuard** = true),
a next action can not run until a previous action has produced this guard.
If **ignoreMultipleTriggers** = true, the next action is only triggered once.
If it is false then the next action is triggered each time the guard is produced
by the previous action(s).
