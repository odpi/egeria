# 0415 Governance Responses

Governance policies define how a governance program will provide support to the governance drives.
They are said to be the "responses to the challenges proposed by the governance drivers".

There are three main types of policy:

* Principles define the overall values and guidelines for the governance program
* Obligations define specific actions or processing that must be accommodated
* Approaches define best practices for how an asset should be implemented and managed.
