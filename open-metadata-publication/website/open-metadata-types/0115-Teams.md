# 0115 Teams

A team is a group of people who are working to a common goal.
The [ActorProfile](0110-Actors.md) is extended to capture more information about a team.
This is recorded in the Team entity.

The roles within the team divide into **Team Leader** and **Team Member**.
A team can have multiple leaders and members.  These roles extend from
[PersonRole](0112-People.md) which links the role to the person appointed.

Figure 1 captures the team profile, the team hierarchy and the
roles within the team.
