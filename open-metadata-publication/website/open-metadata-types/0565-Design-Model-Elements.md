# 0565 Design Model Elements

Design models are used during the development of data structures and their
related software to provide templates and abstractions
of the implementation(s).

Representations of design models are supported in the open metadata
types to support implementation generation and to show the lineage of
software components from their design to implementation.

Model 0565 shows the definition of a generic model element.
