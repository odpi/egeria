# 0215 Software Components

**DeployedSoftwareComponent** describes a code asset that is deployed to implement a 
[software capability](0042-Software-Server-Capabilities.md).
Each software component has a well defined interface describe by an [APISchema](0536-API-Schemas.md) that is
linked to the DeployedSoftwareComponent by the [AssetSchemaType](0503-Asset-Schema.md) relationship.

**DeployedConnector** represents specialist software component called a
**connector** that provides pluggable access to third party
technologies.  These connectors implement the [Open Connector Framework (OCF)](../../../open-metadata-implementation/frameworks/open-connector-framework)
interfaces.

**EmbeddedProcess** describes a processing element nested within a DeployedSoftwareComponent.
The **TransientEmbeddedProcess** describes an EmbeddedProcess that runs only for a short period of time.

These variations are used to provide more information for lineage graphs.

**ProcessHierarchy** defines a parent-child relationship between processes, which can be used to define
more abstract processes that are comprised of lower-level processes; helping to support navigating
the process hierarchy.
