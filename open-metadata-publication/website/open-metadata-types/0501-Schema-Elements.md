# 0501 Schema Elements

Schema are used to represent the structure of data.  They show the fields (also known as attributes or properties)
of the data along with its type.

**SchemaElement** describes the base definition for representing
schema elements in metadata.   The **SchemaType** describes the
top-level name of a schema and also the types of any fields nested in it.
