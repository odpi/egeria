# 0056 Asset Managers

The **AssetManager** classification represents a technology that manages
metadata about assets and may also provide services to manage and/or govern
the assets themselves (or at least track such actions).
Data catalogs and other types of metadata catalogs are examples of
asset managers.
For example, [Amundsen](https://www.amundsen.io/amundsen/), [Marquez](https://marquezproject.github.io/marquez/) and
[Apache Atlas](https://atlas.apache.org) are examples of data catalogs.
An Egeria deployment using a [Metadata Server](../../../open-metadata-implementation/admin-services/docs/concepts/metadata-server.md)
and one or more [Integration Daemons](../../../open-metadata-implementation/admin-services/docs/concepts/integration-daemon.md)
can also be enabled as an asset manager.

The **UserProfileManager** classification describes a system that manages user profile information - such as a company directory.

The **UserAccessManager** classification describes a user directory such as LDAP.

A **MasterDataManager** classification describes a server that manages the rationalization of master data stored in many systems.

## Use of Asset Manager classification

The AssetManager classification on a [SoftwareServerCapability](0042-Software-Server-Capabilities.md) entity
is used by the [Asset Manager OMAS](../../../open-metadata-implementation/access-services/asset-manager)
to represent the third party asset manager that it is exchanging metadata with.

Identities from this third party asset manager are linked to the AssetManager entity
using the [ExternalIdScope](0017-External-Identifiers.md) relationship.
