# Egeria - Open Metadata and Governance
  
Egeria provides the Apache 2.0 licensed [open metadata and governance](open-metadata-publication/website/README.md)
type system, frameworks, APIs, event payloads and interchange protocols to enable tools,
engines and platforms to exchange metadata in order to get the best
value from data, whilst ensuring it is properly governed.
