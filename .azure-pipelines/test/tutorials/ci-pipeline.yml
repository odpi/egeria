# Initial build pipeline to publish from source to a k8s deployment in Azure
# Trigger will be a change to master - ie a merge.
# This overlaps with the standard 'merge.yml' merge build currently, but is separate for debugging
# This pipeline will also build an image from source, rather than using dockerhub
