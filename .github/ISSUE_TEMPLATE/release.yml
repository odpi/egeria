        Create release x.y :

        Prior to the release work
        - [ ] slack post advising of upcoming release & linking to issue
        - [ ] advance warning in developer/community call
        - [ ] final agreement to start branch in team call & identification of outstanding issues
        - [ ] Agree required updates/versions for additional repos including egeria-ui, egeria-reactui, connectors etc

        Branching & Correcting versions
        - [ ] Create branch
        - [ ] Reassign any issues not being worked on to the next release
        - [ ] Update version for main (ie x.y-SNAPSHOT > x.y+1-SNAPSHOT)
        - [ ] Update version for branch (ie x.y-SNAPSHOT -> x.y)

        Final updates to the release
        - [ ] Ensure any remaining fixes are merged into branch (and vice-versa to main)

        Generate a release image for testing
        - [ ] Start release pipeline manually to generate container image

        Updating the React UI (as this is part of the notebook test). Note egeria-ui is out of scope other than inclusion of current release
        - [ ] Create branch
        - [ ] Update version in main
        - [ ] Update version in new branch 
        - [ ] Ensure new container image is available for testing (there is no distinct release pipeline)

        Updating the Helm Charts (egeria-charts repo)
        - [ ] checker correct container images are on docker.io & quay.io (these are built by the 'merge' build of a release)
        - [ ] update image versions for helm charts (egeria-charts repo) (using -prerelease for chart version)

        Final tests
        - [ ] Check swagger doc renders (no regressions)
        - [ ] Verify odpi-egeria-lab chart (pods active/ready)
        - [ ] Verify egeria-base chart (pods active/ready)
        - [ ] Check notebooks (config, start, data catalog at a minimum)
        - [ ] Check polymer UI (only possible to check it runs - no demo scenario for more)
        - [ ] Check React UI (rex, tex, glossary author)
        - [ ] CTS - graph
        - [ ] CTS - inmemory

        Final Docs
        - [ ] Update release notes in egeria-docs

        Final build and publish
        - [ ] Run 'release' pipeline on branch to push candidates to oss.sonatype.org
        - [ ] 'close' staging repo & Validate artifacts ok (number, structure, validations) on oss.sonatype.org
        - [ ] Create final github releases for egeria (add link to egeria docs)
        - [ ] Close repo on oss.sonatype.org (once updated) for egeria, release
        - [ ] Check 'release' repo on oss.sonatype.org has artifacts
        - [ ] Update final versions of egeria-charts to release ie x.y
        - [ ] Publish that release is now shipped via slack #egeria-announce
        - [ ] Additional posts to social media
        - [ ] Communicate to other repo owners ie for connectors so that they can be rebuilt/shipped as needed
