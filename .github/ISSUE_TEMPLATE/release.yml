        - [ ] Reassign any issues not being worked on to the next release
        - [ ] Update version for main (ie x.y-SNAPSHOT > x.y+1-SNAPSHOT)
        - [ ] Update version for release branch (ie x.y-SNAPSHOT -> x.y)

        - [ ] Ensure any remaining fixes are merged into branch (and vice-versa to main)

        - [ ] checker correct container images are on [docker.io](https://hub.docker.com/u/odpi) & [quay.io](https://quay.io/organization/odpi) (these are built by the 'merge' build of a release)
        - [ ] update image versions for helm charts [egeria-charts](https://github.com/odpi/egeria-charts/) repo (using -prerelease for chart version)
          - check/update the [strimzi chart versions](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/releases)
          - check/update supported kafka version used for the strimzi CR in each chart
          - check/update the current [jupyter lab version](https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/minimal-notebook/tags) & generate a new docker image in egeria-jupyter
