# Open Metadata Distribution

This module collects together the Egeria artifacts for different scenarios.  This includes:

* The **[OMAG Server Platform Assembly](omag-server-platform)** assembles the libraries and files for the OMAG Server Platform plus optional resources for use with the platform.
* The **[Egeria UI Application](egeria-ui-application)** contains the runtime for the Egeria's General User UI backend services.
* The **[Open Metadata Assembly](open-metadata-assemblies)** provides a combination of the OMAG Server Platform and the Egeria UI Application.  This is a legacy and is being replaced with the more specialized assemblies described above.
