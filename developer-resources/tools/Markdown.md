# Markdown

Markdown is a simple tagging language that generates HTML webpages.
We use it for documentation (this page is written in markdown for example), in GitHub comments and
in the Jupyter Notebooks that form the teaching material for the
[Hand-on Labs](https://egeria-project.org/education/open-metadata-labs/overview/).

This summary for markdown is very useful
* [Markdown Syntax (from GitHub)](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf)

Markdown files in the git repositories have a file type of `.md`.  Each directory in the repository
(except Java code packages) should have a README.md file in it explaining the content/purpose
of the directory.  This is the default page displayed for the directory.  For example,
click on this link to display the tools directory where this file lives on GitHub.

* [https://github.com/odpi/egeria/tree/master/developer-resources/tools](https://github.com/odpi/egeria/tree/master/developer-resources/tools)

Scroll to the bottom of the page to see the contents of the README.md displayed.

These pages are also used to create Egeria's webpages using a technology called **GitHub pages**.
Click on the next link to display the tools directory in the website.

* [https://egeria.odpi.org/developer-resources/tools/](https://egeria.odpi.org/developer-resources/tools/)

Now you see the same README.md formatted using the website styling.
