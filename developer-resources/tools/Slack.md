# Slack

Slack is an instant messaging tool that allows multiple conversations to occur
amongst the community members at any one time.  Each conversation is called a **channel**.
Channels can be set up for a specific event or have a long term existence.

Egeria uses the [LF AI & Data Slack community](http://slack.lfai.foundation) to provide an ongoing dialogue between members.
This creates a recorded discussion of design decisions and discussions that complement the project meetings.

Follow the link above and register with the LF AI & Data slack service using your email address.
Once signed in you can see all of the active slack channels.
The main slack channel for the Egeria project is called [#egeria-discussion](https://lfaifoundation.slack.com/archives/C01F40J2XA8)

Additional channels are added from time to time as new workgroups and discussion topics are established. For Egeria these 
channel names will begin with '#egeria', you can also view slack channels from other LF AI & Data projects.
