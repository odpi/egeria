# Kubernetes

Kubernetes orchestrates (starts/stops/connects) different containers,
such as [Docker Containers](Docker.md) together so that they can be managed as a complete
solution.

Kubernetes is an open source project managed by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/).
There are many videos and education offerings for kubernetes.
This is the [home page](https://kubernetes.io/) to get you started.

Egeria uses Kubernetes to run all of the components
in the [Coco Pharmaceuticals Hands on Labs](../../open-metadata-resources/open-metadata-labs).
You can run this Kubernetes environment
by following this link to the
[Egeria Lab Helm Chart](https://github.com/odpi/egeria-charts/tree/main/charts/odpi-egeria-lab).
