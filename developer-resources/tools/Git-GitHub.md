# Git and GitHub

Git is an open source version control system.  It is what we use to:

- Store all of our source code, documentation and other file-based resources.
- Track changes to the underlying Egeria code as the project evolves
- Track issues and enhancements, and link these back to the code changes that resolve them
- Collaborate on and review the issues, enhancements and code changes

As a result, it gives us a definitive source for the latest and greatest source code for
Egeria itself, its history, and the rationale behind various decisions that are made over
time.

The Egeria project's git repositories are located on [GitHub](https://github.com/odpi).
GitHub is a free, public git service for sharing code and related files.
It has a web interface to make it easier for the Egeria community to monitor
the activity in the project and process new content.
