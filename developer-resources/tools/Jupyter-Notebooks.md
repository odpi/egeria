# Jupyter Notebooks

[Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) provides tools for interactive computing. In particular, we use
Jupyter notebooks to provide an interactive environment for running snippets of python code, interspersed
with [Markdown](Markdown.md) documentation.

This is an example of a Jupyter notebook from the [Open Metadata Labs](https://egeria-project.org/education/open-metadata-labs/overview/).

A free version of the latest Jupyter Notebook support (called **JupyterHub**) is available
through the **Anaconda Navigator** desktop.  It can be downloaded from the following link:
