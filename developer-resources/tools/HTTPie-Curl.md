# Command line Http request tools - HTTPie and Curl

In addition to [Postman](Postman.md) there are command line tools for
calling REST APIs.

The command that is most commonly available is **curl**.
It uses commands such as:

```bash
$ curl --insecure -X GET https://localhost:9443/open-metadata/platform-services/users/test/server-platform/origin
Egeria OMAG Server Platform (version 3.13-SNAPSHOT)
```

Note that Egeria is using https, so if you have not replaced the provided self-signed certificate, ensure to add '--insecure' to any requests 
to skip certificate validation


As an alternative you might like to try [HTTPie](https://httpie.org/) which has more advanced functions

Note that Egeria is using https, so if you have not replaced the provided self-signed certificate, ensure to add '--verify no' to any requests 
to skip certificate validation
