# Python Programming Language

Python is an interpreted programming language.  It is favored by
data scientists and script writers because it supports writing in snippets
where variables can be created on the fly and are typically global.

Egeria uses python in the [Hands-On Labs](../../open-metadata-resources/open-metadata-labs)
since it is the native language of the [Jupyter Notebooks](../tools/Jupyter-Notebooks.md).
