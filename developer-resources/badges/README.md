# Egeria badges

[Credly's Acclaim platform](https://info.credly.com/how-credly-works)

to hold your professional digital certifications and achievements.

The Egeria project is able to award two types of Acclaim
badges.

Earners of this badge are recognized by the Egeria maintainers as someone who is making a notable contribution to the
Egeria codebase or ecosystem growth.
