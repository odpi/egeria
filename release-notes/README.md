# Egeria Release Notes

Below are the official releases of Egeria.  The project aims to
produce a new release about once a month.  Each release includes
new features and fixes to existing function.  The team aims to
provide complete backward compatibility for all components that
are officially released (to understand more about what it means to have released function see
[Egeria Content Status](../open-metadata-publication/website/content-status)).
If backwards compatible changes are not possible, it will be called out explicitly in the
release notes with an explanation on how to upgrade.

Each release will also upgrade the level of its dependencies to
ensure Egeria is running with all of the latest security patches.
We therefore recommend that you keep moving forward with us to
get the best Egeria experience possible.

One way you can help us is to feedback on your experiences, both good
and bad.  We would love to hear from you.

## Future Releases

Our master branch is currently taking code for all future releases.
Many of the features are large and the teams integrate code for
partial function as soon as it is stable and has no impact on released function.
So you will see support for much more function than is officially released.
This way you can monitor and feedback on future items as they are developed.

The [Road map for Egeria](../open-metadata-publication/website/roadmap)
describes the end vision for Egeria and our current status.
