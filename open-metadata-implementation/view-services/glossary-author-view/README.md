# Glossary Author Open Metadata View Service (OMVS)

![In Development](../../../images/egeria-content-status-in-development.png)

Develop a definition of a subject area by authoring glossaries, including terms for use by a user interface. The Glossary Author OMVS is for user interfaces that support subject matter experts
who are defining glossaries, reference data and rules around data for a specific subject area, such as "customer data". 

This OMVS calls a remote server using the [Subject Area OMAS](../../access-services/subject-area/README.md).


The module structure for the Glossary Author OMVS is as follows:

* [glossary-author-view-server](glossary-author-view-server) supports an implementation of the view service.
* [glossary-author-view-spring](glossary-author-view-spring) supports the REST API using the [Spring](../../../developer-resources/Spring.md) libraries.
