## Open Lineage Services

The Open Lineage Services provides a historic reporting warehouse for lineage. It listens to events that are sent out 
by the [Asset Lineage OMAS](../../access-services/asset-lineage/README.md), and stores lineage data in a graph database. 
This lineage can then be queried through the Open Lineage Services Client and by its REST API, for example by a lineage GUI. 

Open Lineage Services stores lineage data in the Open Metadata format, wile also adding some specific nodes and relationships in order to optimize 
query performance.
