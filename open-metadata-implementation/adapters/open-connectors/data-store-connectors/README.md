# Data Store Connectors

The Data Store Connectors module contains
a small collection of connectors for applications.
The aim is to eventually cover most common types of data sources.
connectors to different types of data stores.  These connectors implement the

[Open Connector Framework (OCF)](../../../frameworks/open-connector-framework) **Connector** interface.

* **[file-connectors](file-connectors)** provides connector to read files.


There is a code sample that shows how to work with the file connector
in the [asset-management-samples](../../../../open-metadata-resources/open-metadata-samples/access-services-samples/asset-management-samples).
