# Data Store Connectors

The Data Store Connectors module contains a small collection of 
[resource connectors](https://egeria-project.org/concepts/digital-resource-connector/) for accessing the most common types of data sources.


* **[file-connectors](file-connectors)** provides connector to read files. There is a code sample that shows how to work with the file connector
in the [asset-management-samples](../../../../open-metadata-resources/open-metadata-samples/access-services-samples/asset-management-samples).
* **[jdbc-resource-connector](jdbc-resource-connector)** provides access to a JDBC resource through a connector.
