# Avro File Connector

The Avro file connector provides access to an Avro file that has been
catalogued using open metadata.

Avro files are files that include a schema along with one or more data records.
The format of the schema and the records is managed by the
[Apache Avro](https://avro.apache.org/) specification.

The API for reading Avro files is based around the Java File object.
This connector provides access to this File object along with the information
from its catalog entry.


The javadoc for Apache Avro is published [here](https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/api/java/index.html))
