# Unity Catalog Connectors

The connectors in this module support interaction with the open source unity catalog.  

See [https://github.com/unitycatalog/unitycatalog](https://github.com/unitycatalog/unitycatalog).

Unity Catalog is an operational metadata catalog that supports controlled access to data managed through a data 
platform.  It provides metadata to describe the organization of the data.  This can be used to overlay a security model to control access.

These connectors form the core implementations for Egeria's [*Leveraging your Unity Catalog Estate* solution](https://egeria-project.org/egeria-solutions/leveraging-unity-catalog/overview/).
