# Egeria Infrastructure Integration Connector (egeria-infrastructure-integration-connector)

The *Egeria Infrastructure Integration Connector* is a *Infrastructure Integration Connector* that listens for the 
cataloguing of SoftwareServerPlatform entities that have the `deployedImplementationType` property set to
`OMAG Server Platform`.  The aim of the connector is to extract as much information about the platform as possible
and add this detail to the catalog.

It needs the URL of the platform.

This connector allows you to experiment with the behavior of an integration connector that listens for specific types of metadata and builds on it.
