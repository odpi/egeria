# The Basic Files Integration Connectors

The basic files integration connectors monitor changes in a file directory (folder) and updates the open metadata
repository/repositories to reflect the changes to both the files and folders underneath it.

The **DataFilesMonitorIntegrationConnector** maintains a DataFile asset for each file in the directory (or any subdirectory).
When a new file is created, a new DataFile asset is created.  If a file is modified, the lastModified property
of the corresponding DataFile asset is updated.  When a file is deleted, its corresponding DataFile asset is also deleted.

The **DataFolderMonitorIntegrationConnector** maintains a DataFolder asset for the directory.  The files and directories
underneath it are assumed to be elements/records in the DataFolder asset and so each time there is a change to the
files and directories under the monitored directory, it results in an update to the lastModified property
of the corresponding DataFolder asset.


## Deployment and configuration

The basic files integration connectors are included in the main Egeria build.
They are designed dependent on the to run in the [Files Integrator OMIS](../../../../integration-services/files-integrator).
