# HTTP Helper

A plug-in for managing Transport Level Security (TLS) in a client.

## Client-side certificate checking

Egeria is set up to validate certificates in the caller to a REST API.
The certificate received from the server is typically validated against
the certificates in the client's trust store.

The HTTP helpers make it possible to turn off this certificate checking.
