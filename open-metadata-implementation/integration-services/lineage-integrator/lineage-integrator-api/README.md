# Lineage Integrator API

The Lineage Integrator integration service's API is a connector interface that defines
the specific context for an integration connector that is managed by this integration service.

The context is the means that the connector has to exchange metadata with the open metadata ecosystem.
Its methods closely follow the methods of the integration service's partner Open Metadata Access Service (OMAS).
That is the [Asset Manager OMAS](../../../access-services/asset-manager) in this case.
