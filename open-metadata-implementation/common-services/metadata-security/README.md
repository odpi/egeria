# Open Metadata Security

Open Metadata Security provides fine-grained authorization services for open metadata services, types and instances.
Since each organization will have different security requirements, the support is implemented through connectors.
Egeria defines the interfaces and when it will call the connector.  You define the behavior when the connector is called
and Egeria acts on the returned decision.
