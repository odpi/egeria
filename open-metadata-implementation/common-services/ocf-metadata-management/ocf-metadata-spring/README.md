# OCF metadata management with Spring

The OCF metadata management spring module uses spring to create the server-side support for the REST services
needed to support the retrieval of metadata about an [asset](../../../access-services/docs/concepts/assets).
The interface is to support the ConnectedAssetProperties object defined in the
[Open Connector Framework (OCF)](../../../frameworks/open-connector-framework).
