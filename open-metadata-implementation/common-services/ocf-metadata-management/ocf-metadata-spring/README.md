# OCF metadata management with Spring

The OCF metadata management spring module uses spring to create the server-side support for the REST services
needed to support the retrieval of metadata about a [resource](https://egeria-project.org/concepts/resource) that is 
linked from an [asset](https://egeria-project.org/concepts/asset).
The interface is to support the ConnectedAssetProperties object defined in the
[Open Connector Framework (OCF)](https://egeria-project.org/frameworks/ocf/overview).
