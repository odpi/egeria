# Generic Handlers

The generic handlers provide services to translate OMAS requests
built around that service's private beans into calls to the repository
services (through the repository handler).
The aim is to reduce the coding needed in the specific handlers used by the Open Metadata Access Services (OMASs) and
ensuring security and visibility of assets and other sensitive objects are managed correctly.
