# Open Metadata Repository Services (OMRS) Archive Utilities

The Open Metadata Repository Services (OMRS) archive utilities provide the common utilities
used to build [Open Metadata Archives](../../../open-metadata-resources/open-metadata-archives).

They are also used inside the OMAG Server when the repository services are reading
an open metadata archive, either at start up, or when an archive is loaded while the server is running.
