# Metadata Collection

A metadata collection refers to a set of metadata instances that are being maintained and accessed as a
coherent set of information.  These instances are explicitly typed using
[open metadata type definitions (TypeDefs)](open-metadata-type-definitions.md).

Typically metadata collections are stored in a single [repository](open-metadata-repository.md).
However, the [Open Metadata Access Services](../../access-services) provide access to
a federated metadata collection called the [enterprise metadata collection](enterprise-metadata-collection.md).
