# Cohort member

A cohort member is a server that has registered
with an **[open metadata repository cohort](open-metadata-repository-cohort.md)**.

The registration process is triggered through 
the **[administrative services](../../admin-services/docs/user)**.
It is necessary to configure an **event bus connector** and then enable
access to a named cohort.   These two commands update the configuration document for
a server and so the next time the open metadata services are activated the configuration is retained.
