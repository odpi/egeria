# Audit Log Store Connector

The Audit Log Store Connector provides a common interface to
an audit log destination.
It is used by the OMRS's **[Audit Log](../audit-log.md).

The OMRS Audit Log supports multiple instances of the Audit Log Store
and will pass audit log records to each configured instance of the
Audit Log Store Connectors.
