# Cohort Services

The cohort services manage the exchange of metadata between a repository and
other members of an **[open metadata repository cohort](../open-metadata-repository-cohort.md)**.
It includes the following components:

* **[OMRS Metadata Highway Manager](../component-descriptions/metadata-highway-manager.md)** - Manages the OMRS Cohort Manager for each
open metadata repository cohort that the local server belongs to.
* **[OMRS Cohort Manager](../component-descriptions/cohort-manager.md)** - Manages the components needed in the local server for
it to act as a member of an open metadata repository cohort.
* **[OMRS Cohort Registry](../component-descriptions/cohort-registry.md)** - Manages registration exchanges with other members of a
cohort on behalf of the local server.
