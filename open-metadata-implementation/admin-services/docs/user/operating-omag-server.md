# Operating an OMAG Server

Once an [OMAG Server](../concepts/omag-server.md) is [configured](configuring-an-omag-server.md)
it can be started and stopped multiple times.

* [Starting and stopping an OMAG Server](starting-and-stopping-omag-server.md)

It is possible to load an [OpenMetadata Archive](../../../../open-metadata-resources/open-metadata-archives)
into running OMAG Servers that are of type [Cohort Member](../concepts/cohort-member.md).

* [Adding an Open Metadata Archive to a running server](adding-archive-to-running-server.md)

In addition there are different platform services that
can be used to find out more about the operation of the servers.

* [Querying the servers and services running in an OMAG Server Platform](../../../platform-services)

Egeria also has an interactive graph-based user interface (UI) that enables you to explore the
open metadata ecosystem.  This includes the OMAG Server Platforms and Servers, the types of metadata
supported by each metadata repository and the contents of the metadata repositories.
It is also possible to maintain the configuration of the OMAG Servers through this UI.
