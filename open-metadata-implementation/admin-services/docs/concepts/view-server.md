# View Server

A **View Server** is an [OMAG Server](omag-server.md)
that hosts the REST API services to support a UI.  
These REST API services are called 
[Open Metadata View Services (OMVS)](../../../view-services) 
and they are designed to support specific display paradigms needed
by different types of UIs.

The view services are are typically
called by the [Presentation Server](presentation-server.md), but may also be used by third parties.
The presentation server hosts the JavaScript that controls the browser display.
