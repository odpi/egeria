# Open Metadata User Interface

Egeria provides a basic user interface (UI) to demonstrate the power of the open
metadata and governance capabilities. They are fully functional as
far as the standards go, and could be used by a small company. However,
it is likely that commercial offerings will offer a richer user experience,
particularly for a larger organization.

There are 2 User Interfaces :

* The **[Presentation Server](.https://egeria-project.org/concepts/presentation-server)** is a multi-tenant server that serves a user interface - it issues rest calls downstream primarily to view
  servers. All the code for the Presentation Server has been moved to [Egeria React UI Git repository](https://github.com/odpi/egeria-react-ui)

*  [UI Application](ui-chassis) the user interface platform. The Server side of the user interface is maintained in the [ui-chassis](ui-chassis) module.
The client side has been moved to [Egeria UI Git repository](https://github.com/odpi/egeria-ui)
