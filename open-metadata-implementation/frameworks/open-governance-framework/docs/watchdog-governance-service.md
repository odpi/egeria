# Watchdog Governance Services

The watchdog governance service monitors changes in the metadata and initiates one of the
following as a result.

* [governance action](governance-action.md)
* [governance action process](governance-action-process.md) 
* [incident report](incident-report.md)

One example of a watchdog governance service is to monitor for new assets. 
Another example is to monitor the addition of
open discovery reports and take action on their content.
