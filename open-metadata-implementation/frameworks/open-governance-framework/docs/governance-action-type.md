A governance action type is a template for a [governance action](governance-action.md).
A set of linked governance action types form the definition of a
[governance action process](governance-action-process.md).

Governance action types are defined through the [Governance Engine OMAS](../../../access-services/governance-engine)
and this OMAS also coordinates the create of a governance action
from the governance action type as part of its execution of the
governance action process.

## Open metadata type definition

[0462 Governance Action Type](https://egeria-project.org/types/4/0462-Governance-Action-Types)
model of the Open Metadata Types.
