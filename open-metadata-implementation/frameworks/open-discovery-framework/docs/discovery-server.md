# Discovery server

The discovery server is the server environment that hosts one or more
[discovery engines](https://egeria-project.org/concepts/open-discovery-engine).

In Egeria, the discovery server is implemented by the
[Asset Analysis](../../../engine-services/asset-analysis) running in the
[Engine Host](https://egeria-project.org/concepts/engine-host) OMAG Server.


## Further information

 * The [Discovery Engine OMAS](https://egeria-project.org/services/omas/discovery-engine/overview)
   provides the metadata service for the discovery server.  It runs in
   a [Metadata Access Server](https://egeria-project.org/concepts/metadata-access-server).
   Many discovery servers can use the same metadata server.
