 * InformationSupplyChainProperties identifies a flow of data between systems in a digital landscape

 * that identify stages in the data flow.  Typically, the segments show how the ownership changes along the
 * supply chain.  This may be caused by a change in technology, or the processing moves to a different
 * part of the organization.  The InformationSupplyChainLinks connect the segments together to show
 * where data flows from/to.  These are important hand off points for data.
