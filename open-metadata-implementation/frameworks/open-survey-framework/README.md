# Open Survey Framework (OSF)
  
The Open Survey Framework (OSF) enables
[metadata survey tools](https://egeria-project.org/features/discovery-and-stewardship/overview)
to integrate with open metadata repositories by defining the interfaces
for the surveyor components (called open survey services) to:

* Access the required configuration for the survey.
* Search for assets in the metadata repository.
* Extract all of the metadata known about a specific asset.
* Record the results of the analysis in the open metadata repository and attach it to the
  asset's metadata for later processing.

More information is available on Egeria's [documentation site](https://egeria-project.org/frameworks/osf/overview/).
