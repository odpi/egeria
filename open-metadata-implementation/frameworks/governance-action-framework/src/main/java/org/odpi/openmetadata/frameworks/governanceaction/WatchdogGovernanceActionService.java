/**
 * The watchdog governance action service is responsible for monitoring changes to the metadata elements and then initiating
 * further governance activity.  It can be written as a log running service that is detecting multiple events over time, or
 * it may just be looking for a specific change before completing.
 *
 * To create your own watchdog governance action service, create a new class that extends this class
 * along with another class that extends the GovernanceActionServiceProviderBase class to act as its connector provider.
 * Add a start() method that begins by calling super.start() and then registers a listener to wait for the desired event(s).
 *
 * THe listener is called each time an event occurs.  It can use the methods on the governance context to:
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Create a governance action to drive a specific governance action service.</li>
 *     <li>Initiate a governance action process.</li>
 *     <li>Create an incident report that will be processed by the incident report governance processes.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * When the watchdog governance action service is complete, it should call
 * governanceContext.recordCompletionStatus() and then return. The recordCompletionStatus() call will include guards that are used to determine
 * the next step if any.
