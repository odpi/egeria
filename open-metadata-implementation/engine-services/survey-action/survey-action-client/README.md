# Survey Action Engine Services Client

The survey action engine services client module contains the client
implementation of the calls to the survey action engine
that request that a particular
[survey action service](https://egeria-project.org/concepts/survey-action-service)
is run against a resource.

It also supports the ability to query the status of such a survey request and
retrieve the resulting 
[survey report](https://egeria-project.org/concepts/survey-report).
