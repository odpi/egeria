# Open Metadata Engine Services (OMES)

The engine services are each able to host a specific
type of governance engine. 

Broadly there are two types of Governance Engines:
* [Open Discovery Engines](../frameworks/open-discovery-framework/docs/discovery-engine.md) that run automatic metadata
discovery requests to analyse the content of an [asset's](../access-services/docs/concepts/assets) real-world counterpart.
* [Governance Action Engines](../frameworks/governance-action-framework/docs/governance-action-engine.md) that
 manage the processing supporting governance processing such as the the resolution of issues reported in the open
metadata ecosystem or the assets it supports.

These engines are supported by the
[Archive Manager OMES](asset-analysis) and
[Governance Action OMES](governance-action) respectively.
