# Open Metadata Engine Services (OMES)

The engine services are each able to host a specific type of [governance engine](https://egeria-project.org/concepts/governance-engine). 

These engines are supported by the [Archive Manager OMES](asset-analysis),
[Governance Action OMES](governance-action) and [Repository Governance OMES](repository-governance).
