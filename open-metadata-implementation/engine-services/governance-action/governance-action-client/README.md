# Governance Action Engine Services Client

The governance action engine services client module contains the client
implementation of the calls to the governance action engine
that request that a particular
[governance action service](https://egeria-project.org/concepts/governance-action-service)
is run.

It also supports the ability to query the status of such a governance action request and
retrieve statistics about the governance actions in progress.
