# Asset Analysis Engine Services Client

The asset analysis engine services client module contains the client
implementation of the calls to the discovery engine
that request that a particular
[open discovery service](https://egeria-project.org/concepts/open-discovery-service)
is run against a resource.

It also supports the ability to query the status of such a discovery request and
retrieve the resulting 
[discovery analysis report](https://egeria-project.org/concepts/discovery-analysis-report).
