# Asset Manager Open Metadata Access Service (OMAS)

The Asset Manager OMAS provides APIs for supporting the
exchange of metadata with a third party asset manager.
An [asset manager](https://egeria-project.org/concepts/basic-concepts/#asset-manager)
is typically a catalog of [assets](https://egeria-project.org/concepts/asset).  It is responsible
for maintaining details of the assets including their characteristics,
ownership, assessments and governance requirements.
