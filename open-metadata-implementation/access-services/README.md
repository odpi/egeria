  The Asset Lineage OMAS listens to relevant lineage related events on the Enterprise topic level and publishes these on
the Asset Lineage OutTopic, combined with relevant context information on the described entities. These events are 
listened to by the Open Lineage Services governance server.  

* **[asset-manager](asset-manager)** - manage exchange of metadata with third party metadata catalogs and
asset managers.

  The Asset Manager OMAS is typically called by the
[Catalog Integrator OMIS](../integration-services/catalog-integrator) to send and receive

* **[data-manager](data-manager)** - exchange metadata with a data manager.

  The Data Manager OMAS provides an integration point to enable technologies that manage collections of data
such as database servers,
file systems, file managers and content managers to publish metadata to the metadata
repositories about the changing structures and content stored in the data platform.
It is typically called from the
[Database Integrator OMIS](../integration-services/database-integrator) and
[Files Integrator OMIS](../integration-services/files-integrator)
integration services.


* **[data-privacy](data-privacy)** - support a data privacy officer.

  The Data Privacy OMAS supports a privacy officer as they manage data privacy
in their organization.
This includes managing privacy impact assessments and reviews of software services
that use personal data as they move through their development, deployment and use.

* **[data-science](data-science)** - manage metadata for analytics.

  The Data Science OMAS provides access to metadata for data assets,
connections and projects, plus the ability to maintain metadata about data science notebooks
and models and log activity during the analytics development process.
It is designed for data science and analytics management tools.

* **[design-model](design-model)** - exchange design model content from tools and standards.

  The Design Model OMAS provides the ability to manage information from all types of design models.
These models may come from tools or be part of a packaged standard.
This content is useful for governance, system integration and software development.

* **[dev-ops](dev-ops)** - manage metadata for a devOps pipeline.
  
  The DevOps OMAS provides services for a DevOps pipeline to query and maintain metadata about systems, processes and
software components that are being deployed into the information landscape.

* **[digital-architecture](digital-architecture)** - support the design and architecture of the digital services
that support the business.

  The Digital Architecture OMAS provides the ability to define information standards, definitions, solution blueprints and
models for an organization.  It is designed for architecture tools.  It is able to support the
definition and management of a digital service through concept to deployment.

* **[digital-service](digital-service)** - manage metadata for a the Egeria Digital Services lifecycle.
  
  The Digital Service OMAS provides services for a managing the lifecycle of an Egeria Digital Service.

* **[discovery-engine](discovery-engine)** - manage metadata for metadata discovery services.

  The Discovery Engine OMAS provides an API for a discovery engine to access and store
metadata from an open
metadata repository (or open metadata repository cohort).

* **[governance-engine](governance-engine)** - manage metadata for an operational governance engine.

  The Governance Engine OMAS provides APIs and events that retrieve and
manage metadata for governance engines.  Governance engines ensure that 
the infrastructure supporting the data landscape is operating according
to the governance program. For example, the governance engine may be ensuring
that individuals and servers
only have access to the data they have been authorized to see.

* **[governance-program](governance-program)** - set up and manage a governance program.

  The Governance Program OMAS provides the ability to maintain a governance program in the open metadata repositories.
It is designed for governance and CDO tools.

* **[it-infrastructure](it-infrastructure)** - manage metadata about deployed infrastructure.

  The IT Infrastructure OMAS provides support for the design and planning of the information infrastructure
that supports the data assets.  This includes the development of system blueprints that link down to the metadata
about real infrastructure components.
This metadata helps in the linkage between information governance metadata
and IT infrastructure management (ITIL) metadata typically stored in a
Configuration Management Database (CMDB).

* **[project-management](project-management)** - manage definitions of projects for metadata
management and governance.

  The Project Management OMAS supports the metadata associated with projects and campaigns.
These projects and campaigns may be for governance projects, or generic data use projects.

* **[security-manager](security-manager)** - exchange security related metadata with security services such as Apache Ranger.

improve the data landscape.

  The Stewardship Action OMAS provides services for managing exceptions discovered in the information landscape that need correcting.
These exceptions may be quality errors, missing or outdated information,
invalid licensing, job failures, and many more.
The Stewardship Action OMAS also enables the review and triage of the exceptions,
simple remediation and status reporting.

* **[subject-area](subject-area)** - develop a definition of a subject area including glossary
terms, reference data and rules.

  The Subject Area OMAS is for tools that support subject matter experts
who are defining glossaries, reference data and rules around data for a specific
subject area, such as "customer data".   It supports the development of a comprehensive
definition of the subject area and the standards that support it.
These definitions can then be folded into the Governance Program,
and used by Asset Owner's to improve the findability and understandability
of their assets by linking their asset's structure to relevant parts of
the subject area definition.

## Using the OMASs

The OMASs run in either a [Metadata Access Point](https://egeria-project.org/concepts/metadata-access-point)
or a [Metadata Access Store](https://egeria-project.org/concepts/metadata-access-store).
They can be configured and activated individually or as a complete set.
The [administration services](../admin-services) provide
the ability to configure, start and stop the access services.

Each OMAS typically supports a REST API, a topic where it publishes notifications
of interest to its users, and a topic where new metadata requests can be posted to the
OMAS.

It also has a Java client that provides access to its API and topics.
This java client is embedded in the
[Governance Servers](https://egeria-project.org/concepts/governance-server) and
[View Servers](https://egeria-project.org/concepts/view-server).
They can also be downloaded and used independently with the 
**[Egeria Client Package](../../open-metadata-distribution)**.  

More information on the OMASs can be found in the [Egeria Documentation](https://egeria-project.org/services/omas).
