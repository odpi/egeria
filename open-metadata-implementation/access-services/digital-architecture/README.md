# Digital Architecture Open Metadata Access Service (OMAS)

The Digital Architecture OMAS provides APIs for tools and applications managing the
design of data structures, software and the IT infrastructure that supports the
operations of the organization.

It is primarily supporting architects and their tools as they are setting up common definitions and standards
that help to increase the consistency of the IT landscape.
