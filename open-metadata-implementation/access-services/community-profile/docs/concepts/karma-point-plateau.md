# Karma Point Plateau

A karma point plateau identifies a significant contribution to open metadata.
By default, a karma point plateau is achieved for every 500 [karma points](karma-point.md) awarded.
However the threshold for the karma point plateau can be 
[changed at server start up](../../community-profile-server/docs/configuration/configuring-the-karma-point-plateau.md).

The Community Profile OMAS generates a
[Karma Point Plateau Event](../../community-profile-api/docs/events/karma-point-plateau-event.md)
each time a person achieves a karma point plateau.
This is sent on the Community Profile OMAS's [OutTopic](https://egeria-project.org/concepts/out-topic)
