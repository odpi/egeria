/**
 * The converters are responsible for converting entities, classifications and relationships retrieved from the
 * open metadata repositories into Open Connector Framework (OCF) beans.
 *
 * The inheritance structure follows closely to the inheritance structure of the beans themselves and the naming
 * convention is consistent.   The converter used is the one that corresponds to the desired bean.
 * When a converter is created, it is passed the entity with its embedded classifications and a relationship if
 * required on the constructor.  The bean is retrieved by calling getBean().
